# Policy

## Summary

-   The summary criterion will refer to the summary of the policy and city you have selected.

Rasjahi is one of the major urban centres in Bangaldesh with a population of around 500,000 people. It is located in the west of the country on the Indian-Bangladesh border and part of the Barind Tract, an area that experiences hot and dry climate. The most pressing climate challenges in the city are flooding during the monsoon season due to a poorly designed and maintained drainage system as well as extreme and dangerous heat.

According to the Word Health Organisation, heatwaves are among the deadliest climate risk globally. In fact, more than 166 000 people died due to extreme temperatures between 1998-2017 (<https://www.who.int/health-topics/heatwaves#tab=tab_3>). In cities heat stress can be exacerbated due to so called urban heat island effects (UHI). UHI is a phenomenon where urban areas experience higher temperatures compared to their surrounding rural areas due to human activities and the way the city is built (e.g. heat retention in buildings, infrastructure, sealed surfaces). With climate change temperatures in Bangladesh are expected to increase and extreme weather events, such as heat waves, are expected to become more frequent and more intense.

At the national level, the Government of Bangladesh has acknowledged the risk posed by increasing heat. In its National Adaptation Plan from 2023 (NAP), heat features as an adaptation priority for urban areas. One of the action items in the urban area strategy of the NAP is to develop "heatwave and disease outbreak advisory services for city dwellers". No further guidance on how to tackle heat in cities is given and it is up to the local level governments to improve heat risk planning. City budgets in Bangladesh tend to be very small, mainly dependent on national government funding transfers. It is often Multilateral Development Banks or donors, who finance urban plans or strategies, as part of the preparation of larger loan programmes.

At the local level in Rajshahi, the City Cooperation has understood the importance of including climate change related hazards, icuding heat, into urban management. In recent years they have developed three important plans:

1.  A Masterplan that incorporate climate change issues (not publicly available, therefore will not discuss further),
2.  The city government worked with ICLEI to develop a Climate Resilient Action Plan (CAP), and with
3.  the Red Cross Red Cresent Climate Centre to develop a heat threshold assessment for Rajshahi.

The ICLEI CAP provides a high level climate risk assessment. It describes UHI as an issue in the city but not spatially. Therefore, suggested mitigation and adaptation actions on heat remain vague.

The RCRC CC study expands ICLEI's work by looking more closely at urban heat in the city and mapping it spatially. The authors used Landsat images between 2010 to 2020 to map Land Surface Temperature in the city to identify heat hotspots and Normalised difference water index (NDWI) and normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) to analyse the relationship between landcover changes and urban heat island effect (UHI). The findings are combined with demographic and socio-economic data to understand vulnerability. However, the demographic and socio-economic datasets from the national cencus are only available by ward. To develop specific actions for mitigating and adapting to the identified hotpots, we need data on the neigbourhood, street and building level. The study presents some high level policy options for mitigation, including increasing green space, housing retrofit and street design.

## Application

-   The application criterion will refer to how the remotely sensed data you sourced could be used to assist with contributing to the policy goal.

Remote sensing data could be used to improve the existing vulnerability assessment by identifying specific neighbourhoods with poor housing conditions, such as slums, where residents are at high risk of extreme indoor heat.

It is likely that Rajshahi does not have high resolution remote sensing data, such a Lidar data. Therefore, it is important to rely on publicly available data to ensure that the local government could reproduce the study. As demonstrated in a study conducted in Jakarta, Landsat 8, data can be used to identify informal settlements, despite lower resolution. A similar approach could be taken here.

Several recent (e.g. from 2023) cloud-free images of the city should be obtained with a resolution of 30m. The relevant bands include: band 1-coastal aerosol, band 2-blue, band 3-green, band 4-red, band 5-near infrared (NIR), and bands 6 & 7-shortwave infrared (SWIR).   The classification of land cover types could be done using Random Forest (RF) classifier combined available survey data of the city's informal settlements and Open Street Map data. If no survey data exists, the local government could identify known informal areas. The sample should cover approximately 0.25% of the total study area to reach high accuracy.

## Reflection

How could the data be applied to solve the policy challenge. The reflection criterion will refer to what you have learnt in relation to the policy, city and the application of the data.

The identified neighbourhoods could be prioritised in investment planning. Incremental upgrading of buildings to reduce indoor temperature or planting of trees in most vulnerable areas could be possible policy options to battle heat stress in an equitable manner, where those most vulnerable are prioritised to achieve more equal living standards across the city.

It is very important to understand vulnerability spatially to take robust planning decisions. Many planning documents, including climate action plans, lack specification in terms of location of specific measures. The ICLEI Climate Action Plan for Rajshahi, for example, suggests increasing green space, but does not specify where. Could include Medellin example.

The goal of planning decisions is usually to maximize the benefit of an investment while minimising costs (cost benefit analysis). The next step after identifying where informal settlements are would be to understand benefits of specific interventions, e.g. by modelling the effects of tree planting in different locations. This was done by xxx.
