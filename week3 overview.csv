Term ,Description 
Geometric Correction ,"Remote sensed data often have image distortion issues due to the angle its taken from (off-nadir, meaning not directly down), the topography, or the rotation of the earth. This can be fixed by taking Ground Control Points (GPS) and matching them with known points in the image and a reference dataset (goldstandard, we know its corrrect) using different algorithms. 
"
Atmospheric Correction,"Absorption and scattering crate atmospheric haze and makes pixels bleed into one another, which makes the image less clear (less contrast). There are two sources of environmental attenuation: Atmospheric scattering and topographic attenuation."
Orthorectification Correction,"Georectification = giving coordinates to an image 
Orthorectification = removing distortions... making the pixels viewed at nadir "
Dark Object Subtraction (DOS),"Method to correct for atmospheric effects and sensor-specific artifacts. In DOS, the darkest objects in an image, such as shadows or non-reflective surfaces, are identified and assumed to represent the true ""dark"" or background signal. The pixel values of these dark objects are then subtracted from the entire image, effectively normalizing the data and reducing atmospheric influence. DOS helps enhance the contrast and accuracy of satellite imagery, particularly in areas with varying atmospheric conditions or topography."
Digital Number (DN),"The raw number that the sensor stores, or the value that the sensor ""sees"" (no unit)."
Radiance,"Radiance is derived from DN. DN to spectral radiance = radiometric calibration. It refers to the electromagnetic radiation emitted or reflected from the Earth's surface and recorded by the sensors/satellites (e.g., light reflected from a tree). It represents the intensity of radiation across different wavelengths or spectral bands. Is used as a measurement for understanding different materials on the earth surface (e.g., vegitation). Also called Top Of the Atmosphere Reflectance. "
Surface Reflectance,Radiance after correction for atmospheric effects. Also called Bottom of Atmosphere Reflectance. 
"Collection, level and Tier","Collection, Level and Tier help us decide what remote sensing data product to choose, when downloading data. 

Collection comes in 1 and 2 with a difference in how the data was collected. We always use 2 because it is the latest release. Levels refer to the quality of data and also comes in 1 and 2, where 1 = DN and 2=surface rediance. Tier refers to the quality of data, where 1 is the highest. 

So going forward, we usually use: 
Collection=2
Level=2
Tier=1"

Principal Component Analysis (PCA),"PCA is a statistical technique used for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction from multispectral or hyperspectral imagery. By transforming the original spectral bands into a smaller set of uncorrelated variables called principal components, PCA simplifies analysis tasks and aids in data compression. These components capture different aspects of variability in the imagery, such as brightness, texture, or spectral signatures, facilitating efficient storage, noise reduction, and visualization of remote sensing data."
