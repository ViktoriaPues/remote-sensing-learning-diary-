  abstract = {Remote sensing (RS) systems have been collecting massive volumes of datasets for decades, managing and analyzing of which are not practical using common software packages and desktop computing resources. In this regard, Google has developed a cloud computing platform, called Google Earth Engine (GEE), to effectively address the challenges of big data analysis. In particular, this platform facilitates processing big geo data over large areas and monitoring the environment for long periods of time. Although this platform was launched in 2010 and has proved its high potential for different applications, it has not been fully investigated and utilized for RS applications until recent years. Therefore, this study aims to comprehensively explore different aspects of the GEE platform, including its datasets, functions, advantages/limitations, and various applications. For this purpose, 450 journal articles published in 150 journals between January 2010 and May 2020 were studied. It was observed that Landsat and Sentinel datasets were extensively utilized by GEE users. Moreover, supervised machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, were more widely applied to image classification tasks. GEE has also been employed in a broad range of applications, such as Land Cover/land Use classification, hydrology, urban planning, natural disaster, climate analyses, and image processing. It was generally observed that the number of GEE publications have significantly increased during the past few years, and it is expected that GEE will be utilized by more users from different fields to resolve their big data processing challenges.},

  abstract = {As one of the swiftly advancing megacities globally, Lagos faces significant challenges in managing its urban expansion. Mainly, this study focuses on monitoring and predicting urban growth using a comprehensive approach incorporating Global Land 30 (GL30), satellite-based nighttime light observations, and built-up and population density data. The application of remote sensing techniques, combined with utilizing the GL30 dataset, provides an effective means to monitor and predict urban growth trends and patterns. The major patterns occurred from 2000 to 2020, including increased cultivated land; reductions in grasslands, shrublands, and wetlands; and major urbanization. Predictive models indicate that urbanization will continue. Furthermore, employing the Cellular Automata (CA) Markov model in land-use and land-cover (LULC) change prediction. The findings revealed significant changes in LULC over the two decades. Particularly, the percentage of artificial terrain increased from 17.016\% to 25.208\%, and the area under cultivation increased significantly, rising from 46,771 km2 (1.238\%) in 2000 to 75,283 km2 (1.993\%) in 2020. Grasslands fell from 7.839\% to 1.875\%, while forest cover somewhat increased, climbing from 39.319\% to 43.081\%. Additionally, marshes fell from 9.788\% to 5.646\%, while shrublands decreased from 4.421\% to 2.640\%. Surprisingly, bare ground decreased sharply from 0.677\% to 0.003\%. To forecast future LULC changes, the study also used a Markov Chain Transition Matrix. According to the data, there is a 3.54\% chance that agricultural land will become urban, converting it from being used for agriculture to urban development. On the other hand, just 1.05\% of forested regions were likely to become municipal areas. This study offers foundations for the upcoming research to enhance urban growth models and sustainability strategies in the face of rising urbanization and environmental concerns in the region, as well as laying the groundwork for informed decision-making in the region.},

In terms of the management of the environment and water resources, precise identification is required of areas susceptible to flooding to support planners in implementing effective prevention strategies. The objective of this study is to develop a novel hybrid approach based on Bald Eagle Search (BES), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Bagging (BA) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to generate a flood susceptibility map in Thua Thien Hue province, Vietnam. In total, 1621 flood points and 14 predictor variables were used in this study. These data were divided into 60\% for model training, 20\% for model validation and 20\% for testing. In addition, various statistical indices were used to evaluate the performance of the model, such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Receiver Operation Characteristics (ROC), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The results show that BES, for the first time, successfully improved the performance of individual models in building a flood susceptibility map in Thua Thien Hue, Vietnam, namely SVM, RF, BA and MLP, with high accuracy (AUC {$>$} 0.9). Among the models proposed, BA-BES was most effective with AUC = 0.998, followed by RF-BES (AUC = 0.998), MLPBES (AUC = 0.998), and SVM-BES (AUC = 0.99). The findings of this research can support the decisions of local and regional authorities in Vietnam and other countries regarding the construction of appropriate strategies to reduce damage to property and human life, particularly in the context of climate change.},

  abstract = {Unlike most disasters, drought does not appear abruptly. It slowly builds over time due to the changes in different environmental and climatological factors. It is one of the deadly disasters that has plagued almost every region of the globe since early civilization. Droughts are scientifically being studied with the help of either simple or composite indices. At 500-m spatial resolution, this study presents global scale drought severity index (DSI), a composite index using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), 8-day temporal resolution evapotranspiration (ET), potential evapotranspiration (PET), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). This index is mainly used to identify meteorological droughts and also has proven reliable for studying agriculture droughts. In this study, Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud-based geospatial data computational platform, is used for drought mapping and monitoring from 2001 to 2019. For annual DSI spatial maps, the statistical median is computed ranging from\,−\,1 to\,+\,1, which means drought struck or dry regions have values closer to negative, and wet zones have values near to positive. For the validity of DSI results, the findings are compared with available records of droughts struck in previous years. This study declares that continent-wise, Australia, Africa, and Asia have the most extreme and frequent drought events while South America and North America come a close second. Europe is the least affected by this particular weather event when compared to other continents.},

  abstract = {Accurate and reliable informal settlement maps are fundamental decision-making tools for planning, and for expediting informed management of cities. However, extraction of spatial information for informal settlements has remained a mammoth task due to the spatial heterogeneity of urban landscape components, requiring complex analytical processes. To date, the use of Google Earth Engine platform (GEE), with cloud computing prowess, provides unique opportunities to map informal settlements with precision and enhanced accuracy. This paper leverages cloud-based computing techniques within GEE to integrate spectral and textural features for accurate extraction of the location and spatial extent of informal settlements in Durban, South Africa. The paper aims to investigate the potential and advantages of GEE’s innovative image processing techniques to precisely depict morphologically varied informal settlements. Seven data input models derived from Sentinel 2A bands, band-derived texture metrics, and spectral indices were investigated through a random forest supervised protocol. The main objective was to explore the value of different data input combinations in accurately mapping informal settlements. The results revealed that the classification based on spectral bands + textural information yielded the highest informal settlement identification accuracy (94\% F-score). The addition of spectral indices decreased mapping accuracy. Our results confirm that the highest spatial accuracy is achieved with the ‘textural features’ model, which yielded the lowest root-mean-square log error (0.51) and mean absolute percent error (0.36). Our approach highlights the capability of GEE’s complex integrative data processing capabilities in extracting morphological variations of informal settlements in rugged and heterogeneous urban landscapes, with reliable accuracy.},

In this study, Landsat 5, 7, and 8 were utilized to map flood inundation areas. Google Earth Engine (GEE) was used to implement Flood Mapping Algorithm (FMA) and process the Landsat data. FMA relies on developing a “data cube”, which is spatially overlapped pixels of Landsat 5, 7, and 8 imagery captured over a period of time. This data cube is used to identify temporary and permanent water bodies using the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and site-specific elevation and land use data. The results were assessed by calculating a confusion matrix for nine flood events spread over the globe. The FMA had a high true positive accuracy ranging from 71–90\% and overall accuracy in the range of 74–89\%. In short, observations from FMA in GEE can be used as a rapid and robust hindsight tool for mapping flood inundation areas, training AI models, and enhancing existing efforts towards flood mitigation, monitoring, and management.},

  abstract = {Significance             Satellite imagery is becoming ubiquitous. Research has demonstrated that artificial intelligence applied to satellite imagery holds promise for automated detection of war-related building destruction. While these results are promising, monitoring in real-world applications requires high precision, especially when destruction is sparse and detecting destroyed buildings is equivalent to looking for a needle in a haystack. We demonstrate that exploiting the persistent nature of building destruction can substantially improve the training of automated destruction monitoring. We also propose an additional machine-learning stage that leverages images of surrounding areas and multiple successive images of the same area, which further improves detection significantly. This will allow real-world applications, and we illustrate this in the context of the Syrian civil war.           ,              Existing data on building destruction in conflict zones rely on eyewitness reports or manual detection, which makes it generally scarce, incomplete, and potentially biased. This lack of reliable data imposes severe limitations for media reporting, humanitarian relief efforts, human-rights monitoring, reconstruction initiatives, and academic studies of violent conflict. This article introduces an automated method of measuring destruction in high-resolution satellite images using deep-learning techniques combined with label augmentation and spatial and temporal smoothing, which exploit the underlying spatial and temporal structure of destruction. As a proof of concept, we apply this method to the Syrian civil war and reconstruct the evolution of damage in major cities across the country. Our approach allows generating destruction data with unprecedented scope, resolution, and frequency—and makes use of the ever-higher frequency at which satellite imagery becomes available.},

  abstract = {Our cities are the frontier where the battle to achieve the global sustainable development agenda over the next decade would be won or lost. This requires an evidence-based approach to local decision-making and resource allocation, which can only be possible if current gaps in urban data are bridged. Earth observation (EO) offers opportunities to provide timely, spatially disaggregated information that supports this need. Spatially disaggregated information, which is also demanded by cities for forward planning and land management, has not received much attention largely due to three reasons: (i) the cost of generating this data through traditional methods remains high; (ii) the technical capacity in geospatial sciences in many countries is low due to a shortage of skilled professionals who can find and/or process available data; and (iii) the inertia against disturbing routine workflows and adopting new practices that are not imposed through legal requirements at the country level. In support of overcoming the first two challenges, this paper discusses the importance of EO data in the urban context, how it is already being used by some city leaders for decision making, and what other applications it offers in the realm of urban sustainability monitoring. It also illustrates how the EO community, via the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and its members, is working to make this data more easily accessible and lower barriers of use by policymakers and urban practitioners that are interested in implementing and tracking sustainable development in their jurisdictions. The paper concludes by shining a light on the challenges that remain to be overcome for better adoption of EO data for urban decision making through better communication between the two groups, to enable a more effective alignment of the produced data with the users’ needs.},

  abstract = {"The unprecedented growth of data and its ubiquity in our daily lives signal that the digital revolution is transforming the world. But despite this growth, much of the value of data remains untapped, waiting to be realized. Data collected for one particular purpose has the potential to generate economic value in applications far beyond those originally anticipated. However, many barriers stand in the way of such beneficial reuse of data, ranging from misaligned incentives and incompatible data systems to a fundamental lack of trust. The World Development Report 2021: Data for Better Lives will explore the tremendous potential of the changing data landscape to improve the lives of poor people, but also to open backdoors that can harm individuals, businesses, and societies. The first part of the report assesses how better use and reuse of data can enhance the design of public policies, programs, and service delivery, as well as improve market efficiency and job creation through private sector growth. The second part of the report focuses on issues of governance, law, policy, and infrastructure that can help realize data's potential benefits while safeguarding against harmful outcomes. By examining these opportunities and challenges, the report aims to show how data can benefit the lives of poor people in low- and middle-income countries"--},

  abstract = {Because of its high spatial resolution (10 m and 20 m), rich spectral information (10 spectral bands), and short revisit period (5 days), Sentinel-2 provides new opportunities for earth observation. However, in urban environments, data limitations in the spatial and spectral dimensions constrain Sentinel-2’s performance: (i) the spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 is not sufficient to resolve the heterogeneous urban landscapes, and the prevalence of mixed pixels lowers the performance of image classifiers; (ii) the spectral resolution of Sentinel-2 is not able to fully account for the spectral variability of urban surface materials, which increases the probability that image classifiers mislabels urban land covers. Also, the 5-day temporal resolution makes Sentinel-2 image data suitable for time series analysis, but its contribution to urban land cover mapping still needs to be quantified. This study evaluated Sentinel-2’s performance in mapping urban land covers by mitigating the effect of spectral variability (using FDA, Fisher Discriminant Analysis), improving the spatial resolution of images (using UnFuSen2, a state-of-art Sentinel-2 image fusion approach), and utilizing temporal and spectral characteristics from image time series. Overall, we found that the image time series processed by UnFuSen2 enables the classifiers of k nearest neighbor (KNN), maximum likelihood (MLC), and random forests (RF) to perform the best, and multiple endmember spectra mixture analysis (MESMA) is suitable for classifying image time series that have been jointly processed by FDA and UnFuSen2. Besides, we found a significant contribution of spring and summer imagery to the improvement of land cover mapping accuracy in the Brussels Capital Region.},
