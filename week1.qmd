# Getting started with Remote Sensing

## Summary

This week, I am covering the basics of what remote sensing is and will focus on how remote sensing is based on the electro magnetic field. Other topics this week included scattering, interaction with the earth surface, data formats, and resolution.

Remote Sensing, also referred to as Earth Observation, refers to the process of collecting information about the Earth's surface from a distance. The information is obtained through aerial photography by airplanes or drones, or from satellite images. The foundation of Remote Sensing the electromagnetic radiation or more simply put light reflected from objects. @bradyRemoteSensingDummies2021

The Electro Magnetic Spectrum (EMS) has a huge range of energy waves, electric or magnetic, that vary in amplitude (α), length (λ), and frequency @bradyRemoteSensingDummies2021. Only a fraction of the spectrum is visible to the human eye. Those that are visible, we see as colors. All objects on the earth reflect electromagnetic waves in unique ways. For exmaple, trees have a different electromagnetic signature than buildings or water bodies.

The images taken through remote sensing include wavelengths beyond those that are visible to the human eye. Therefore, analysis of this information allows us to see much more than what would be possible to see on e.g., a simple photography. Sections on the electric magnetic spectrum are captured in so called "bands". The more bands, the higher the spectral resolution of the image.

Generally, there are two types of sensors -- active and passive ones. Passive sensors use the sun as their energy source, while active sensors have their own energy source and therefore emit electromagnetic waves (Slides).

## Application

As for many other technologies, remote sensing has its origin in the military and defense sector. It was first invented to gather information about the enemy in war, e.g. troop deployment or battle territory @bradyRemoteSensingDummies2021. While still used in this sector, today remote sensing has been adopted in a range of other disciplines as well including:

-   Climate science (e.g., measuring changes in temperature over time),

-   Environmental science (e.g. measuring water quality),

-   Geology (e.g. measuring volcanic activity),

-   Urban Planning (e.g., identifying informal settlements and tracing urban growth),

-   Conflict studies (e.g., measuring destruction in battle) and many more.


Below I discuss two studies using the two types of sensors that we worked with in the practical, Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2. You can find more info on Sentinel in a short presentation in the week 2 section. Both of the studies are in the field of disaster mapping, a field that I find facinating. 

### Flood Mapping in Mozambique Using Copernicus Sentinel-2 Satellite Data

Mozambique has been hit by numerous devastating cyclone over the past two decades that cause many floods with tremendous human casualties and economic loss. @twumasiFloodMappingMozambique2022, mapped inundation caused by tropical cyclones in Maputo and Beira using Sentinel 2 data. This was combined with demographic data to understand the impact of these floods on people. 

Some of the image processing methods applied sound already somewhat familiar as we covered them in the lecture: “The images were geometrically corrected to remove, haze, scan lines and speckles, and then referenced to Mozambique ground-based Geographic: Lat/Lon coordinate system and WGS 84 Datum. Data from twelve spectral bands of Sentinel-2 satellite, covering the visible and near infrared sections of the electromagnetic spectrum, were further used in the analysis.” @twumasiFloodMappingMozambique2022

Something that I noticed is that the study only takes into account the growing population for forecasting but not the effects of climate change on the likelihood and intensity of tropical cyclones in the future.

### add another study here using landset data

## Reflection

Next to learning about the electromagnetic field (something I hadn't really thought about since 8th grade physics lessons) an issue that was interesting to me this week, was the range of different satellites available delivering imagery at different quality and cost. 

In my work in the international development sector, we are often constraint to using publicly available data. This is due to tight project budgets but also because work done by external consultants should be reproducible by the beneficiary themselves, e.g. a local government. I wonder to what extend this presents a barrier for using remote sensing in the development and humanitarian sector. In fact, it seems that many of the free resources of satellite images provide good enough resolution for many planning and policy decisions. The International Monetary Fund for example, already considered remote sensing as a low cost option for data collection in comparison to airborne or ground surveys in 1992.  @bhattSateEteRemoteSensing1992 Today, there is much more satellite images available and analysis has become easier, using applications like Google Earth Engine. 

Even though remote sensing is a low cost option for data collection, it is not yet applied yet in large scale in the area I work in (urban planning & international development). According to a recent paper on the potetnial of remote sensing for the urban developemnt sector, this may be due to limited capabilities in local governments and reluctancy to change existing data collection and management systems. @prakashOpenEarthObservations2020
