    "text": "1.1 Summary\nThis week, I am covering the basics of what remote sensing is. The topic is fairly new to me, so I will keep it simple.\nRemote Sensing, also referred to as Earth Observation, refers to the process of collecting information about the Earth’s surface from a distance. The information is obtained through aerial photography by airplanes or drones, or from satellite images. The foundation of Remote Sensing the electromagnetic radiation or more simply put light reflected from objects. Brady (2021)\nThe Electro Magnetic Spectrum (EMS) has a huge range of energy waves, electric or magnetic, that vary in amplitude (α), length (λ), and frequency Brady (2021). Only a fraction of the spectrum is visible to the human eye. Those that are visible, we see as colors. All objects on the earth reflect electromagnetic waves in unique ways. For exmaple, trees have a different electromagnetic signature than buildings or water bodies.\nThe images taken through remote sensing include wavelengths beyond those that are visible to the human eye. Therefore, analysis of this information allows us to see much more than what would be possible to see on e.g., a simple photography. Sections on the electric magnetic spectrum are captured in so called “bands”. The more bands, the higher the spectral resolution of the image.\nGenerally, there are two types of sensors – active and passive ones. Passive sensors use the sun as their energy source, while active sensors have their own energy source and therefore emit electromagnetic waves (Slides).\nknitr::include_graphics('figures/w1p1.png')\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Electric and magnetic waves in the electromagnetic field\n{r include_image, out.width=‘100%’, fig.cap=‘Figure 2: Amplitude, length, and frequency of electric wave’, fig.scap=‘Image Source: Principles of Remote Sensing’}knitr::include_graphics(‘figures/w1p2.png’)",

    "text": "1.2 Application\nAs for many other technologies, remote sensing has its origin in the military and defense sector. It was first invented to gather information about the enemy in war, e.g. troop deployment or battle territory Brady (2021).\nWhile still used in this sector, today remote sensing has been adopted in a range of other disciplines as well including:\n\nClimate science (e.g., measuring changes in temperature over time),\nEnvironmental science (e.g. measuring water quality),\nGeology (e.g. measuring volcanic activity),\nUrban Planning (e.g., identifying informal settlements and tracing urban growth),\nConflict studies (e.g., measuring destruction in battle) and many more.",

    "text": "1.3 Reflection\nNext to learning about the electromagnetic field (something I hadn’t really thought about since 8th grade physics lessons) an issue that was interesting to me this week, was the range of different satellites available delivering imagery at different quality and cost. In my work in the international development sector, we are often constraint to using publicly available data. This is due to tight project budgets but also because work done by external consultants should be reproducible by the beneficiary themselves, e.g. a local government. I wonder to what extend this presents a barrier for using remote sensing in the development and humanitarian sector. In fact, it seems that many of the free resources of satellite images provide good enough resolution for many planning and policy decisions. The International Monetary Fund for example, considers remote sensing as a low cost option for data collection in comparison to airborne or ground surveys.

    "text": "3.1 Summary\nThis week had a lot of very technical content around the concepts of corrections, merging images and enhancement. Honestly, a bit overwhelming at first. The good news is that a lot of the methods covered this week are automated, when using tools like Google Earth Engine. Therefore, for me it is important to understand the broad concepts rather than how each method is exactly implemented. The table below provides short explanations for some of the concepts of this week. I used the lecture slides, the practical content and Chat GPT to compile this table.\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.3     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.3     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nWarning: package 'kableExtra' was built under R version 4.3.2\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'kableExtra'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    group_rows\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nGeometric Correction\nRemote sensed data often have image distortion issues due to the angle its taken from (off-nadir, meaning not directly down), the topography, or the rotation of the earth. This can be fixed by taking Ground Control Points (GPS) and matching them with known points in the image and a reference dataset (goldstandard, we know its corrrect) using different algorithms.\n\n\nAtmospheric Correction\nThere are two sources of environmental attenuation: Atmospheric scattering and Topographic attenuation. Absorption and scattering crate atmospheric haze and makes pixels bleed into one another, which makes the image less clear (less contrast)\n\n\nOrthorectification correction\nGeorectification = giving coordinates to an image Orthorectification = removing distortions... making the pixels viewed at nadir\n\n\nDark Object Subtraction (DOS)\nMethod to correct for atmospheric effects and sensor-specific artifacts. In DOS, the darkest objects in an image, such as shadows or non-reflective surfaces, are identified and assumed to represent the true \"dark\" or background signal. The pixel values of these dark objects are then subtracted from the entire image, effectively normalizing the data and reducing atmospheric influence. DOS helps enhance the contrast and accuracy of satellite imagery, particularly in areas with varying atmospheric conditions or topography.\n\n\nDigital Number (DN)\nThe raw number, or the value that the sensor sees.\n\n\nRadiance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nGeometric Correction\nRemote sensed data often have image distortion issues due to the angle its taken from (off-nadir, meaning not directly down), the topography, or the rotation of the earth.

It sounds like that makes it easier to focus on the analysis and get to the fun and interesting bits more quickly, rather than spending a long time making corrections and enhancements to the data.
