    "text": "1.1 Summary\nThis week, I am covering the basics of what remote sensing is and will focus on how remote sensing is based on the electromagnetic field. Other topics this week included scattering, interaction with the earth surface, data formats, and resolution.\nRemote Sensing, also referred to as Earth Observation, is the process of collecting information about the Earth’s surface from a distance. The information is obtained through aerial photography by airplanes or drones, or from satellite images. The foundation of Remote Sensing the electromagnetic radiation or more simply put light reflected from objects. Brady (2021)\nThe Electro Magnetic Spectrum (EMS) has a huge range of energy waves, electric or magnetic, that vary in amplitude (α), length (λ), and frequency Brady (2021). Only a fraction of the spectrum is visible to the human eye. Those that are visible, we see as colors. All objects on the earth reflect electromagnetic waves in unique ways. For exmaple, trees have a different electromagnetic signature than buildings or water bodies.\nThe images taken through remote sensing include wavelengths beyond those that are visible to the human eye. Therefore, analysis of this information allows us to see much more than what would be possible to see on e.g., a simple photography. Sections on the electric magnetic spectrum are captured in so called “bands”. The more bands, the higher the spectral resolution of the image.\nGenerally, there are two types of sensors – active and passive ones. Passive sensors use the sun as their energy source, while active sensors have their own energy source and therefore emit electromagnetic waves (Slides).\nknitr::include_graphics('figures/w1p1.png')\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Electric and magnetic waves in the electromagnetic field\nknitr::include_graphics('figures/w1p2.png')\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Amplitude, length, and frequency of electric wave",

    "text": "1.2 Application\nAs for many other technologies, remote sensing has its origin in the military and defense sector. It was first invented to gather information about the enemy in war, e.g. troop deployment or battle territory Brady (2021). While still used in this sector, today remote sensing has been adopted in a range of other disciplines including:\n\nClimate science e.g., measuring changes in temperature over time,\nDisaster Risk Reduction and Management, e.g., mapping flood risks,\nEnvironmental science e.g., measuring water quality,\nGeology e.g., measuring volcanic activity,\nUrban Planning e.g., identifying informal settlements and monitoring urban growth,\nConflict studies e.g., measuring destruction in battle\n\nBelow I discuss the use of Sentinel and Landsat data in the field of disaster risk reduction, more specifically flood risk management. Both Landsat and Sentinel data are being used for flood mapping.\n\n1.2.1 Approach to aaapping of flood areas using landsat\nFigure 3 provides an overview of a typical work flow for a flood risk mapping using Landsat Data. We will understand these steps better over the coming weeks. In short, Landsat 5, 7, and 8 images with low cloud cover are used to cover a longer period. A classifier that differentiates permanent water from temporary water (flood) is applied and vegetation and site specific other data (HAND) is masked (cut out) to leavev only a map of permanent and temporary water.The authors discuss that the accuracy of the classifier could be improved by training it on sentinel data. I think this may be due to the fact that sentinel data has a higher resolution (10m) than Landsat (30m).They also state that this map does not consider socio-demographic data to understand vulnerability. Mehmood, Conway, and Perera (2021)\n\nknitr::include_graphics('figures/w1f4.png')\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Workflow Flood Mapping\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Flood Mapping in Mozambique using Copernicus Sentinel-2 Satellite Data\nTwumasi et al. (2022), do just that. They mapped inundation caused by tropical cyclones in Maputo and Beira using Sentinel 2 data and combined they findings with demographic data to understand the impact of these floods on people.\nSome of the image processing methods applied sound already somewhat familiar as we covered them in the lecture: “The images were geometrically corrected to remove, haze, scan lines and speckles, and then referenced to Mozambique ground-based Geographic: Lat/Lon coordinate system and WGS 84 Datum. Data from twelve spectral bands of Sentinel-2 satellite, covering the visible and near infrared sections of the electromagnetic spectrum, were further used in the analysis.” Twumasi et al. (2022)\nSomething that I noticed is that the study only takes into account the growing population for forecasting but not the effects of climate change on the likelihood and intensity of tropical cyclones in the future.\n\nknitr::include_graphics('figures/w1p3.png')\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Senitnel 2 image of Mosampique flooding including in Maputo",

    "text": "1.3 Reflection\nNext to learning about the electromagnetic field (something I hadn’t really thought about since 8th grade physics lessons) an issue that was interesting to me this week, was the range of different satellites available delivering imagery at different quality and cost.\nIn my work in the international development sector, we are often constraint to using publicly available data. This is due to tight project budgets but also because work done by external consultants should be reproducible by the beneficiary themselves, e.g. a local government. I wonder to what extend this presents a barrier for using remote sensing in the development and humanitarian sector. In fact, it seems that many of the free resources of satellite images provide good enough resolution for many planning and policy decisions. The International Monetary Fund for example, already considered remote sensing as a low cost option for data collection in comparison to airborne or ground surveys in 1992. (bhattSateEteRemoteSensing1992?) Today, there is much more satellite images available and analysis has become easier, using applications like Google Earth Engine.\nEven though remote sensing is a low cost option for data collection, it is not yet applied yet in large scale in the area I work in (urban planning & international development). According to a recent paper on the potential of remote sensing for the urban development sector, this may be due to limited capabilities in local governments and reluctance to change existing data collection and management systems.

    "text": "3.1 Summary\nThis week had a lot of very technical content around the concepts of corrections, merging images and enhancement. Honestly, a bit overwhelming at first. The good news is that a lot of the methods covered this week are automated, when using tools like Google Earth Engine. Therefore, for me it is important to understand the broad concepts rather than how each method is exactly implemented. To this end, the table below provides short explanations for some of the concepts of this week. I used the lecture slides, the practical content, Michael Hathorn’s Learning Diary, and Chat GPT to compile this table.\nWarning: package 'kableExtra' was built under R version 4.3.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nGeometric Correction\nRemote sensed data often have image distortion issues due to the angle its taken from (off-nadir, meaning not directly down), the topography, or the rotation of the earth. This can be fixed by taking Ground Control Points (GPS) and matching them with known points in the image and a reference dataset (goldstandard, we know its corrrect) using different algorithms.\n\n\nAtmospheric Correction\nAbsorption and scattering crate atmospheric haze and makes pixels bleed into one another, which makes the image less clear (less contrast). There are two sources of environmental attenuation: Atmospheric scattering and topographic attenuation.\n\n\nOrthorectification Correction\nGeorectification = giving coordinates to an image Orthorectification = removing distortions... making the pixels viewed at nadir\n\n\nDark Object Subtraction (DOS)\nMethod to correct for atmospheric effects and sensor-specific artifacts. In DOS, the darkest objects in an image, such as shadows or non-reflective surfaces, are identified and assumed to represent the true \"dark\" or background signal. The pixel values of these dark objects are then subtracted from the entire image, effectively normalizing the data and reducing atmospheric influence. DOS helps enhance the contrast and accuracy of satellite imagery, particularly in areas with varying atmospheric conditions or topography.\n\n\nDigital Number (DN)\nThe raw number that the sensor stores, or the value that the sensor \"sees\" (no unit).\n\n\nRadiance\nRadiance is derived from DN. DN to spectral radiance = radiometric calibration. It refers to the electromagnetic radiation emitted or reflected from the Earth's surface and recorded by the sensors/satellites (e.g., light reflected from a tree). It represents the intensity of radiation across different wavelengths or spectral bands. Is used as a measurement for understanding different materials on the earth surface (e.g., vegitation). Also called Top Of the Atmosphere Reflectance.",

    "text": "3.2 Application\nThis week was very concept heavy. I decided to use this week and next to engage with an application area of remote sensing that I have always been interested in: mapping informal settlements in cities. I wanted to see if I come across some of the concepts described above, reading through the studies.\nInformal settlements are often the most vulnerable parts of cities. They tend to be located in areas that are extremely vulnerable to the effects of climate change, such as flooding or heat and lack basic urban services, such as sanitation infrastructure or public transport. Makeshift houses leave residents exposed to the elements, and provide little protection against intruders. Many people living in informal settlements lack security of tenure and are under constant threat of eviction. What may look like temporary neighborhoods often remain for decades. One of the most famous examples, is Dharavi in Mumbai. Dharavi is one of the largest slums in the world right in the center of Mumbai (Figure 3).\n\nknitr::include_graphics('figures/w3p1.png')\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3:Darawi\n\n\n\n\nI looked into a few studies that use remote sensing to map informal settlements and turns out its “a mammoth task due to the spatial heterogeneity of urban landscape components, requiring complex analytically processes.” Matarira, Mutanga, and Naidu (2022)\nIt seems that many studies use Very High Resolution (VHR) and High Resolution (HR) satellite imagery. Such data sets are expensive and therefore not accessible for local governments, especially in low and middle income countries, where most slums are. “Using Open Data to Detect the Structure and Pattern of Informal Settlements: An Outset to Support Inclusive SDGs’ Achievement” (n.d.) More recently, researchers tried to find methods to work with openly available data sets such as Sentinel or Landsat to identify informal settlements.\nI looked more closely at a study conducted in Durban South Africa. Matarira, Mutanga, and Naidu (2022) The paper investigates different data input combinations in order to find the one that presents most accurate and reliable findings.The study uses Google Earth Engine to process Sentinel 2 images of the city of Durban integrating spectral and textural features in order to understand the extent and location of informal settlements. The study found that a classification based on spectral bands and textural information has the highest accuracy. It was able to detect informal settlements with a 80% accuracy.\nThe method used was pretty complex and I didn’t understand it fully. I still summarized the key steps below, which I found useful as it gave me a rough understanding of the workflow and effort of such an analysis. Broad steps of the method listed below:\n\n3 images were selected to form a composite, and a median value was assigned to each pixel, resulting in a single image used for processing.\nExtraction of spectral and texture features from Sentinel 2A bands,\nEstablishing different combinations of these feature types to be tested,\nRandom Forest Classification using GEE,\nAssessment of the classifer’s accuracy (20 classification results were obtained for each input feature set),\nPerformance evaluation of feature subsets through a comparison of classification results of different feature subsets against the original feature set from which they were derived in order to establish if feature reduction would significantly improve informal settlement identification or not.\nAccuracy assessment to develop the relative comparative performances of different feature sets, against the benchmark experiment and was tested using Pixel-Based Accuracy Assessment and patch based.\nRegression between Extracted Informal Settlement Areas and Ground Truth Data.\n\nIt is great that the data used in this study is free. However, it still does not seem very accessible to a local government in a LMIC because technical capabilities to procure, let alone conduct such a study seems immense. It would be great if there was a spatial application that allowed city governments to map slums in their city in an automated way or at least with less technical requirements. Ollie Ballinger actually managed to built an interesting Google Earth Engine Application to map slums in Dar es Salam in Tansania. It is different to the approach taken in Durban because he remove the formal buildings and than applies classification only on the remaining areas.

It sounds like that makes it easier to focus on the analysis and get to the fun and interesting bits more quickly, rather than spending a long time making corrections and enhancements to the data. Thank you Google…\nI was not aware how difficult it is to map informal settlements with remote sensing data. I actually assumed it would be one of the easier methods as it is so well known. I can’t say that I completely understood the method used in Durban. However, it was still a worth wile exercise for me because it gave me a better idea of the workflow for remote sensing.

    "text": "4.1 Summary\nRasjahi is one of the major urban centres in Bangaldesh with a population of around 500,000 people. It is located in the west of the country on the Indian-Bangladesh border and part of the Barind Tract, an area that experiences hot and dry climate. The most pressing climate challenges in the city are flooding during the monsoon season due to a poorly designed and maintained drainage system as well as extreme and dangerous heat.\nAccording to the Word Health Organisation, heatwaves are among the deadliest climate risk globally. In fact, more than 166,000 people died due to extreme temperatures between 1998-2017 (https://www.who.int/health-topics/heatwaves#tab=tab_3). In cities heat stress can be exacerbated due to so called urban heat island effects (UHI). UHI is a phenomenon where urban areas experience higher temperatures compared to their surrounding rural areas due to human activities and the way the city is built (e.g. heat retention in buildings, infrastructure, sealed surfaces). With climate change temperatures in Bangladesh are expected to increase and extreme weather events, such as heat waves, are expected to become more frequent and more intense.\nAt the national level, the Government of Bangladesh has acknowledged the risk posed by increasing heat. In its National Adaptation Plan from 2023 (NAP), heat features as an adaptation priority for urban areas. One of the action items in the urban area strategy of the NAP is to develop “heatwave and disease outbreak advisory services for city dwellers”. No further guidance on how to tackle heat in cities is given and it is up to the local level governments to improve heat risk planning. City budgets in Bangladesh tend to be very small, mainly dependent on national government funding transfers. It is often Multilateral Development Banks or donors, who finance urban plans or strategies, as part of the preparation of larger loan programmes.\nAt the local level in Rajshahi, the City Cooperation has understood the importance of including climate change related hazards, icuding heat, into urban management. In recent years they have developed three important plans:\nThe ICLEI CAP provides a high level climate risk assessment. It describes UHI as an issue in the city but not spatially. Therefore, suggested mitigation and adaptation actions on heat remain vague.",

The authors used Landsat images between 2010 to 2020 to map Land Surface Temperature in the city to identify heat hotspots and Normalised difference water index (NDWI) and normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) to analyse the relationship between landcover changes and urban heat island effect (UHI). The findings are combined with demographic and socio-economic data to understand vulnerability. However, the demographic and socio-economic datasets from the national cencus are only available by ward. To develop specific actions for mitigating and adapting to the identified hotpots, we need data on the neigbourhood, street and building level. The study presents some high level policy options for mitigation, including increasing green space, housing retrofit and street design.\nRemote sensing data could be used to improve the existing heat vulnerability assessment by identifying specific neighborhoods with poor housing conditions, such as slums, where residents are at higher risk of extreme indoor heat. This would take the Red Cross Climate Center to the next level.\nIt is likely that Rajshahi does not have high resolution remote sensing data, such a Lidar data. Therefore, it is important to rely on publicly available data to ensure that the local government could reproduce the study. As demonstrated in a study conducted in Jakarta, Landsat 8, data can be used to identify informal settlements, despite lower resolution. A similar approach could be taken here. “Using Open Data to Detect the Structure and Pattern of Informal Settlements: An Outset to Support Inclusive SDGs’ Achievement” (n.d.)\nSeveral recent (e.g. from 2023) cloud-free images of the city should be obtained with a resolution of 30m. The relevant bands include: band 1-coastal aerosol, band 2-blue, band 3-green, band 4-red, band 5-near infrared (NIR), and bands 6 & 7-shortwave infrared (SWIR). The classification of land cover types could be done using Random Forest (RF) classifier combined available survey data of the city’s informal settlements and Open Street Map data. If no survey data exists, the local government could identify known informal areas. The sample should cover approximately 0.25% of the total study area to reach high accuracy. “Using Open Data to Detect the Structure and Pattern of Informal Settlements: An Outset to Support Inclusive SDGs’ Achievement” (n.d.)",

Incremental upgrading of buildings to reduce indoor temperature or planting of trees in most vulnerable areas could be possible policy options to battle heat stress in an equitable manner, where those most vulnerable are prioritised to achieve more equal living standards across the city.\nIt is very important to understand vulnerability spatially to take robust planning decisions. Many planning documents, including climate action plans, lack specification in terms of location of specific measures. The ICLEI Climate Action Plan for Rajshahi, for example, suggests increasing green space, but does not specify where. Could include Medellin example.\nThe goal of planning decisions is usually to maximize the benefit of an investment while minimising costs (cost benefit analysis). The next step after identifying where informal settlements are would be to understand benefits of specific interventions, e.g. by modelling the effects of tree planting in different locations.\n\n\n\n\n“Using Open Data to Detect the Structure and Pattern of Informal Settlements: An Outset to Support Inclusive SDGs’ Achievement.” n.d.
