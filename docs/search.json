On the following pages you’ll find my learning diary for the module Remote Sensing, which is part of the MSc Urban Spatial Science at the CASA, the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis at the University College London. For each week, you’ll find a short summary of the concepts covered that week, some examples of how they are applied and some personal reflections.\nI am a part time student. When I’m not studying, I work as an urban planner in the international development sector. I have been working in this field for the past 5 years in different roles - as an urban development consultant for a multidisciplinary built environment consultancy (Atkins) and as a policy advisor to the Ministry for International Development in Germany. Over the years, I worked on the design and implementation of urban development projects and programmes, mainly linked to climate change and urban resilience as well as reconstruction in a range of cities in Low and Middle Income countries, including Gyumri in Armenia, Kharkiv in Ukraine, Rasjahi in Bangladesh, Mandera in Kenya, Alexandria in Egypt.\nFrom my experience, a key challenge in these projects is a lack of reliable data on the urban systems that can serve as a baseline for policy making and investment planning. This challenge is particularly acute in small cities in Africa and Asia, where the majority of urbanisation is predicted to take place in the future.\nI am studying the remote sensing module because I believe that remote sensing and earth observation have great potential for closing this data gap and thereby improving urban planning, policy and investment decisions, especially in Low and Middle Income Countries. Within this industry, there seems to be a lot of talk around the potential of this technology but very few people who can actually do the analysis or run programmes where such analysis is done. I want to become one of the people who can put remote sensing into practice and make it work for the international development and humanitarian sector.\n\nTherefore, i will relate the content covered in this module places and topics that are relevant within this sector. Some of the issues, I find interesting include:\nmonitor informal urban growth to better plan for informal settlements,\nmonitoring conflict and assess damage as a baseline for reconstruction processes,\nmeasuring drought to prevent famine,\nunderstand climate change related risks in cities, especially heat and flooding.",

    "text": "1.1 Summary\nThis week, I am covering the basics of what remote sensing is and will focus on how remote sensing is based on the electro magnetic field. Other topics this week included scattering, interaction with the earth surface, data formats, and resolution.\nRemote Sensing, also referred to as Earth Observation, refers to the process of collecting information about the Earth’s surface from a distance. The information is obtained through aerial photography by airplanes or drones, or from satellite images. The foundation of Remote Sensing the electromagnetic radiation or more simply put light reflected from objects. Brady (2021)\nThe Electro Magnetic Spectrum (EMS) has a huge range of energy waves, electric or magnetic, that vary in amplitude (α), length (λ), and frequency Brady (2021). Only a fraction of the spectrum is visible to the human eye. Those that are visible, we see as colors. All objects on the earth reflect electromagnetic waves in unique ways. For exmaple, trees have a different electromagnetic signature than buildings or water bodies.\nThe images taken through remote sensing include wavelengths beyond those that are visible to the human eye. Therefore, analysis of this information allows us to see much more than what would be possible to see on e.g., a simple photography. Sections on the electric magnetic spectrum are captured in so called “bands”. The more bands, the higher the spectral resolution of the image.\nGenerally, there are two types of sensors – active and passive ones. Passive sensors use the sun as their energy source, while active sensors have their own energy source and therefore emit electromagnetic waves (Slides).\nknitr::include_graphics('figures/w1p1.png')\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Electric and magnetic waves in the electromagnetic field\nknitr::include_graphics('figures/w1p2.png')\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Amplitude, length, and frequency of electric wave",

    "text": "1.2 Application\nAs for many other technologies, remote sensing has its origin in the military and defense sector. It was first invented to gather information about the enemy in war, e.g. troop deployment or battle territory Brady (2021). While still used in this sector, today remote sensing has been adopted in a range of other disciplines as well including:\n\nClimate science (e.g., measuring changes in temperature over time),\nEnvironmental science (e.g. measuring water quality),\nGeology (e.g. measuring volcanic activity),\nUrban Planning (e.g., identifying informal settlements and tracing urban growth),\nConflict studies (e.g., measuring destruction in battle) and many more.\n\nBelow I discuss two studies using the two types of sensors that we worked with in the practical, Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2. You can find more info on Sentinel in a short presentation in the week 2 section. Both of the studies are in the field of disaster mapping, a field that I find facinating.\n\n1.2.1 Flood Mapping in Mozambique Using Copernicus Sentinel-2 Satellite Data\nMozambique has been hit by numerous devastating cyclone over the past two decades that cause many floods with tremendous human casualties and economic loss. Twumasi et al. (2022), mapped inundation caused by tropical cyclones in Maputo and Beira using Sentinel 2 data. This was combined with demographic data to understand the impact of these floods on people.\nSome of the image processing methods applied sound already somewhat familiar as we covered them in the lecture: “The images were geometrically corrected to remove, haze, scan lines and speckles, and then referenced to Mozambique ground-based Geographic: Lat/Lon coordinate system and WGS 84 Datum. Data from twelve spectral bands of Sentinel-2 satellite, covering the visible and near infrared sections of the electromagnetic spectrum, were further used in the analysis.” Twumasi et al. (2022)\nSomething that I noticed is that the study only takes into account the growing population for forecasting but not the effects of climate change on the likelihood and intensity of tropical cyclones in the future.\n\nknitr::include_graphics('figures/w1p3.png')\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Senitnel 2 image of Mosampique flooding including in Maputo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 add another study here using landset data\ntbc.",

    "text": "1.3 Reflection\nNext to learning about the electromagnetic field (something I hadn’t really thought about since 8th grade physics lessons) an issue that was interesting to me this week, was the range of different satellites available delivering imagery at different quality and cost.\nIn my work in the international development sector, we are often constraint to using publicly available data. This is due to tight project budgets but also because work done by external consultants should be reproducible by the beneficiary themselves, e.g. a local government. I wonder to what extend this presents a barrier for using remote sensing in the development and humanitarian sector. In fact, it seems that many of the free resources of satellite images provide good enough resolution for many planning and policy decisions. The International Monetary Fund for example, already considered remote sensing as a low cost option for data collection in comparison to airborne or ground surveys in 1992. (bhattSateEteRemoteSensing1992?) Today, there is much more satellite images available and analysis has become easier, using applications like Google Earth Engine.\nEven though remote sensing is a low cost option for data collection, it is not yet applied yet in large scale in the area I work in (urban planning & international development). According to a recent paper on the potetnial of remote sensing for the urban developemnt sector, this may be due to limited capabilities in local governments and reluctancy to change existing data collection and management systems.

    "section": "",
    "text": "3.1 Summary\nThis week had a lot of very technical content around the concepts of corrections, merging images and enhancement. Honestly, a bit overwhelming at first. The good news is that a lot of the methods covered this week are automated, when using tools like Google Earth Engine. Therefore, for me it is important to understand the broad concepts rather than how each method is exactly implemented. The table below provides short explanations for some of the concepts of this week. I used the lecture slides, the practical content and Chat GPT to compile this table.\nWarning: package 'kableExtra' was built under R version 4.3.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nGeometric Correction\nRemote sensed data often have image distortion issues due to the angle its taken from (off-nadir, meaning not directly down), the topography, or the rotation of the earth. This can be fixed by taking Ground Control Points (GPS) and matching them with known points in the image and a reference dataset (goldstandard, we know its corrrect) using different algorithms.\n\n\nAtmospheric Correction\nThere are two sources of environmental attenuation: Atmospheric scattering and Topographic attenuation. Absorption and scattering crate atmospheric haze and makes pixels bleed into one another, which makes the image less clear (less contrast)\n\n\nOrthorectification correction\nGeorectification = giving coordinates to an image Orthorectification = removing distortions... making the pixels viewed at nadir\n\n\nDark Object Subtraction (DOS)\nMethod to correct for atmospheric effects and sensor-specific artifacts. In DOS, the darkest objects in an image, such as shadows or non-reflective surfaces, are identified and assumed to represent the true \"dark\" or background signal. The pixel values of these dark objects are then subtracted from the entire image, effectively normalizing the data and reducing atmospheric influence. DOS helps enhance the contrast and accuracy of satellite imagery, particularly in areas with varying atmospheric conditions or topography.\n\n\nDigital Number (DN)\nThe raw number, or the value that the sensor sees.\n\n\nRadiance",

    "section": "3.2 Application",
    "text": "3.2 Application\nThis week was very concept heavy. Therefore, I decided to use this week to engage with an application area of remote sensing that I have always been interested in (mapping informal settlements in cities) and see if I come across some of the concepts described above.\nInformal settlements are often the most vulnerable parts of cities. They tend to be located in areas that are extremely vulnerable to the effects of climate change, such as flooding or heat and lack basic urban services, such as sanitation infrastructre or public transport. Makeshift houses leave residents exposed to the elements, and provide little protection against intruders. Many people living in informal settlements lack security of tenure and are under constant threat of eviction. What may look like temporary neighborhoods often remain for decades. One of the most famous examples, is Dharavi in Mumbai. Dharavi is one of the largest slums in the world right in the center of Mumbai (Figure 1).\nadd image\nI looked into a few studies that use remote sensing to map informal settlements and turns turns out its “a mammoth task due to the spatial heterogeneity of urban landscape components, requiring complex analytical processes.” Matarira, Mutanga, and Naidu (2022)\nIt seems that many studies use Very High Resolution (VHR) and High Resolution (HR) satellite imagery. Such data sets are expensive and therefore not accessible for local governments, especially in low and middle income countries, where most slums are. “Using Open Data to Detect the Structure and Pattern of Informal Settlements: An Outset to Support Inclusive SDGs’ Achievement” (n.d.) More recently, researchers tried to find methods to work with openly available datasets such as sentinel or landsat to identify informal settlements.\nI looked more closely at a study conducted in Durban South Africa. Matarira, Mutanga, and Naidu (2022) The paper investigates different data input combinations in order to find the one that presents most accurate and reliable findings.The study uses Google Earth Engine to process Sentinel 2 images of the city of Durban integrating spectral and textural features in order to understand the extent and location of informal settlements. The study found that a classification based on spectral bands and textural information has the highest accuracy. It was able to detect informal settlements with a 80% accuracy.\nThe method used was pretty complex and I didnt understand it fully. I still summarized the key steps below, which I found useful as it gave me a rough understanding of the workflow and effort of such an analysis. Broad steps of the method listed below:\n\nExtraction of spectral and texture features from Sentinel 2A bands,\nEstablishing different combinations of these feature types to be tested,\nRandom Forest Classification using GGE,\nReplication of understand accuracy of the classier’s perfromance, (20 classification results were obtained for each input feature set).\nPerformance evaluation of feature subsets through a comparison of classification results of different feature subsets against the original feature set from which they were derived in order to establish if feature reduction would significantly improve informal settlement identification or not.\nAccuracy assessment to develop the relative comparative performances of different feature sets, against the benchmark experiment and was tested using Pixel-Based Accuracy Assessment and patch based.\nRegression between Extracted Informal Settlement Areas and Ground Truth Data.\n\nIt is great that the data used in this study is free. However, it still does not seem very accessible to a local government in a LMIC because technical capabilities to procure, let alone conduct such a study seem immense. It would be great if there was a spatial application that allowed city governments to map slums in their city in an automated way or at least with less technical requirement. Ollie Ballinger actually managed to built an intresting Google Earth Engine Application to map slums in Dar es Salam in Tansania. It is different to the approach taken in Durban because he remove the formal buidlings and than works applies classification only on the remaining areas.\nadd image",

It sounds like that makes it easier to focus on the analysis and get to the fun and interesting bits more quickly, rather than spending a long time making corrections and enhancements to the data. Thank you Google…\nI was not aware how difficult it is to map informal settlements with remote sensing data. I actually assumed it would be one of the easier methods as it is so well known. I can’t say that I completly understood the method used in Durban. However, it was still a worth wile excersise for me because it gave me a better idea of what the workflow for remote sensing. It seems to be roughly: Choosing and downloading the images, making corrections on it, identifying the relevant features (spectral and texture), classification, validating and testing accuracy, spatial analysis (e.g. regression).\n\n\n\n\nMatarira, Dadirai, Onisimo Mutanga, and Maheshvari Naidu. 2022. “Google Earth Engine for Informal Settlement Mapping: A Random Forest Classification Using Spectral and Textural Information.” Remote Sensing 14 (20, 20): 5130. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14205130.\n\n\n“Using Open Data to Detect the Structure and Pattern of Informal Settlements: An Outset to Support Inclusive SDGs’ Achievement.” n.d.
